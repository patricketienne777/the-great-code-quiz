# the-great-code-quiz

This week's assignment was dedicated to creating a fun little quiz. This being one of my first assignments, I was still getting the hang of using html and css but javascript is an entirely different beast.
My favorite part of putting this assignment together has to be connecting elements and giving them functionality through javascript. This assignment really broadend my understanding of code and it gave me a reference to base my knowledge of these languages one.
I am excited for the next !
